This assignment was completed on Seneca Matrix.
The purpose of my script is to create fully functioning Fabric tasks. The tasks will be:
addUser(name) to create a new user on the remote system,
findUser(name) to determine if the user being searched is currently existing on the system,
listUser to list all shell users on the system,
listSysUser to list all system users on the system.

For the addUser task, I used the useradd command combined with the name that the user would enter
when running the task and added sudo because it is a change to the system and cannot run without it.

For the listUser task, I used a combination of commands bonded together by pipes. First, I used the
getent command to get entries of every user with a password. Next, I use grep to search /bin/bash
for user logins. The last part is using cut to set the delimeter for the search, and cutting out the
first field by using the f1 option. The first field of our previous search contains the user names.

For the listSysUser task, I used the same format as the listUser task. The only change I had to make
was using grep to search for "nologin" because the system users do not have logins such as the 
regular users. The purpose of my "for" statement is to properly set the output by making the output
into a list and add the content into the results.

For the findUser task, I used a similar format to the previous tasks. The getent command would remain
the same, however I am using the cut command before my grep search so that no names would be excluded.
After the cut, I would then use grep in combination with the name the user has entered to find a name
in the list of users on the system. I end the task with an "if" statement which will inform the user
if the user has been found on the system or not.
